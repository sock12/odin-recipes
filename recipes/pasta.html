    <p>A healthy veggie-packed garlic parmesan pasta with chicken and roasted bell peppers. Flavorful and easy to make for dinner!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces uncooked rotini (whole grain preferred or gluten free if desired)</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, peeled sliced</li>
        <li>1 zucchini, chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 orange bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 yellow bell pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chicken broth, plus more if necessary</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound chicken breasts, organic if available</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat broiler to high. Cut bell peppers in half and place on foil-lined baking sheet, skin sides up. Broil for 8-10 minutes or until blackened.</li>
        <li>Once blackened, remove from oven and transfer to a plastic ziploc bag. This will help the skin sweat so that you are able to peel it off easily. Keep in bag 10 minutes, then peel and slice into strips; set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together two tablespoons of olive oil, chicken broth, garlic, basil, parmesan cheese, basil and oregano; set aside. Next, generously season chicken with salt and pepper and set aside.</li>
        <li>While peppers are cooking and/or sweating, you can cook the pasta according to package directions.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, drizzle a teaspoon of olive oil and add in carrots and zucchini. Saute while pasta cooks. If carrots and zucchini absorb all oil add in a few tablespoons of chicken broth. </li>
        <li>Next, drain pasta, transfer back to skillet and turn heat to low; stir in the Parmesan cheese mixture. </li>
        <li>Add in sliced roasted bell peppers. Add salt and pepper to taste. Keep pasta over low heat while you cook the chicken.</li>
        <li>Heat a separate skillet over medium-high heat and drizzle two teaspoons of olive oil in. Add in chicken and cook for 6-8 minutes on each side or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. </li>
        <li>Slice chicken and then add to pasta. Sprinkle with a bit more parmesan cheese. Serves 6, about 1 1/2 cups each.</li>
    </ol>
